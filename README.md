### Hi there! My name is Duda and I'm in the last year of high school. I know how to code in java, html and css at the moment, but I'm not a professional yet. I know a lot about the english language and have good comunication skills. I really like to read and to spend my free time learning more about coding. I'm not working in any professional project right now, I'm focused in school and in ENEM, but I'd really like to collaborate in the future. You can reach me in my e-mail: mariaphb.damata@gmail.com. My pronouns are she/her by the way!
